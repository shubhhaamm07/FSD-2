# 🌟 Experiment–2: UI Components using React & Material UI

A modern and responsive React application built as part of **Experiment–2**, focusing on reusable UI components and clean design using **Material UI (MUI)**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the creation and reuse of UI components in React. The application includes multiple pages (**Home, About, Contact**) connected using **React Router**, styled with **Material UI** and enhanced with custom CSS for a professional look.

The goal is to understand **component-based architecture**, **routing**, and **UI design principles** in React.

---

## 🧩 UI Components Implemented

The following **5 reusable UI components** were created using Material UI:

1. 🔘 **Button** – For actions like Submit, Send, Contact Us
2. 📝 **TextField** – For user input (Name, Email, Feedback)
3. ⬇️ **Select** – Dropdown selection component
4. ⭐ **Rating** – Star rating component
5. ☑️ **Checkbox** – Accept terms / Subscribe options

These components are reused across all pages.

---

## 📄 Pages Included

- 🏠 **Home Page** – User input form with rating and submit action
- ℹ️ **About Page** – Feedback and agreement form
- 📞 **Contact Page** – Contact form with subscription option

Navigation between pages is handled using **React Router** with a Material UI Navbar.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React.js**
- **Material UI (MUI)**
- **React Router DOM**
- **CSS3 (Advanced Styling & Animations)**
- **Vite** (for fast development server)
